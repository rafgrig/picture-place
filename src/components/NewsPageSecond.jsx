          Over the last several years, street art has developed from a
          subculture to an internationally acclaimed form of artistic
          expression. What once was referred to as vandalism is today a globally
          acclaimed medium of storytelling, cultural expression, and social
          commentary. Cities across the world are adopting street art, turning
          bare walls into beautiful works of art that motivate and astound
          locals and visitors alike. Showing no indication of slowing down, its
          popularity, street art is transforming cityscapes, opening up new
          possibilities for artists, and impacting popular culture. The
          Evolution of Street Art Street art is an ancient phenomenon that has
          been around since ancient civilizations when humans used to paint
          murals on walls to narrate stories. Nonetheless, contemporary street
          art developed during the second half of the 20th century,
          predominantly in New York City between the 1970s and 1980s. Artists,
          usually anonymously, painted public property with their artwork as a
          way of conveying political views, outrage, and creativity. Street art
          was initially categorized as illegal and an act of rebellion, but with
          time, people started admiring it for its beauty. Nowadays, numerous
          cities embrace and legitimize street art, contracting artists to
          create huge murals. Corporations and governments appreciate its
          potential in beautifying cityscapes, drawing tourists, and
          establishing cultural identity. Street art festivals and shows like
          the UK's Upfest and Canada's Mural Festival attract tens of thousands
          of visitors annually, which demonstrates that street art is far from
          being relegated to back alleys and derelict buildings. Why Street Art
          is Gaining Popularity There are a number of reasons why street art is
          so popular. One of the biggest reasons is social media. Platforms like
          Instagram and TikTok allow artists to share their work with a global
          audience. A mural that was once unnoticed on a side street can now be
          viewed by millions of people online, with admiration from art lovers
          all over the world. The provocative and often striking nature of
          street art also lends itself to online sharing, further contributing
          to its popularity. Another factor is growing support from
          municipalities and businesses. More and more cities have begun to see
          the cultural and economic value of street art. They partner with
          artists to produce murals that make public spaces more beautiful,
          attract tourists, and even function as advertisements. In Yerevan,
          Armenia, for instance, street art is emerging as a characteristic of
          the cityscape, with murals showing Armenian history and current social
          challenges. Moreover, street art is democratic. Different from
          conventional art, which tends to be restricted in galleries and
          museums, street art is open to all for no fee. This makes it possible
          for individuals of any status to experience and be a part of art at
          their disposal. It also opens doors for upcoming artists to bring
          their work to the limelight without the limitations of the traditional
          art world. The Future of Street Art As street art becomes more
          popular, it will only get more diverse. With new technology, like 3D
          murals and interactive displays, the idea of what constitutes street
          art is being pushed. Large cities around the globe are also
          implementing legal street art programs, with open spaces where artists
          are free to create. And finally, street art is not just a painted
          wallâ€”it's a phenomenon that demonstrates culture, creativity, and
          community. As more individuals recognize its artistic and social
          merit, its reach will only continue to grow.
